## C++ code

The C++ code for each exercise is placed in the **/Exercises_XX/exY/** folder path, except for Exercises_04 and Exercises_07, in these cases the code can be found in the /MDVNE_MCNVT/ folder, Exercises_06, related code can be found in /ISING_1D/, Exercises_11 and Exercises_12, in these cases there isn't any code, because these exercises, focused on the Neural Networks, do not need any.

Each code can be compiled using the command **make** followed by the name of the *.cpp* file with file extension *.exe* (for example: "make ex1.exe"). There are exception even for compiling:

1. MDNVE_MCNVT code can be compiled using: "make NVE_NVT.exe";
2. ISING_1D code can be compiled using: "make Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.exe".

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter notebooks contain the exposition of the data and the results obtained from the C++ simulations, for Exercises from 01 to 10, in each folder there are the *.ipynb* file and the folders which contain the data that have been treated, each of them is referred to an exercise (for example: "Exercises_01/dataEx1/" contains the data for exercise 01.1).
